# Decentralized Public Service Performance Tracking

## Overview

The Decentralized Public Service Performance Tracking system leverages blockchain technology to create a transparent, tamper-proof platform for monitoring and evaluating government service delivery. By establishing a trustless framework for performance measurement, this system enables citizens, oversight bodies, and government agencies themselves to access reliable data on public service efficiency, effectiveness, and equity. The platform addresses critical challenges in public sector accountability: data manipulation concerns, reporting inconsistencies, lack of standardization, siloed information, and limited public visibility.
